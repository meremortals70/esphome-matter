# esphome-matter
ESPHome external component adding Matter 1.5 support via Espressif's [esp-matter 1.5.1](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_matter/versions/1.5.1).

> [!WARNING]

> This project is still in early-development so don't expect a perfectly working setup. Both matter-over-wifi and
> matter-over-thread are now working. It's possible to commission a device to a matter controller but some features such
> as binding are still missing.
> 
> Only very few Matter endpoints are supported yet. Currently only the `on_off_switch`, `dimmer_switch`, `temperature_sensor`,
> `on_off_light` and `dimmable_light` endpoints are supported. More will be added soon!
> 
> Also, esphome-matter heavily relies on platformio now. So while esphome is moving to the esp-idf toolchain, this is
> not yet supported by esphome-matter.

# Contributing

Help is very welcome! I'm not deeply experienced in the ESPHome, Espressif, or connectedhomeip ecosystems. If you know your way around any of these and spot something wrong or have ideas, please open an issue or PR.

Even if you have no experience with any of these: just building the project and confirming (or reporting) whether it works on your setup is genuinely useful. [Open an issue](https://github.com/DavidvtWout/esphome-matter/issues) if something doesn't work or create or join a [discussion](https://github.com/DavidvtWout/esphome-matter/discussions) if you have feature requests or ideas.

# Progress

- matter-over-wifi: If you have configured `wifi` in the device config, matter announces itself via mDNS and you can commission it on-network.
- matter-over-thread: When the `openthread` component is configured, `esphome-matter` attaches to the OpenThread stack and SRP client. On-network commissioning is working.
- matter-over-ethernet: Not sure... If you have a device with ethernet port, please report if this works!
- commissioning over BLE: If no network (`wifi`, `openthread`, `ethernet`) is configured at all, matter falls back to 
  BLE commissioning. This is how almost every matter device is commissioned. This mode is currently not compatible with
  the `api` component since this checks network connectivity in a rather naive way that always fails if no network is
  configured. This bug can only be fixed in ESPHome itself.
- binding: Binding (for example a button to a light) requires matter devices to find each other via dns-sd. This is not yet working.

See the [issue page](https://github.com/DavidvtWout/esphome-matter/issues) for more planned features.

# Commissioning

Directly after flashing ESPHome (and after every restart), the commissioning code (starting with `MT:`) is printed in the logs:
```
[C][matter]: Matter:
[C][matter]:   SetupQRCode: MT:Y.K904QI14-O992WI00
[C][matter]:   QR URL: https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT:Y.K904QI14-O992WI00
[C][matter]:   Manual pairing code: 32552014321
[C][matter]:   Commissioning window: open
[C][matter]:   Fabrics: none
```

Copy the code and use this to commission the device. In python-matter-server you can commission the device with the `Commission existing device` option.
Keep in mind that the commissioning window remains open for only 15 minutes. A restart of the device will re-open the window but only if it hasn't joined any fabrics yet.
